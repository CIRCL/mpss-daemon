\n\
        By default the micctrl utility creates the predefined file system\n\
        information in the /var/mpss directory for Xeon Phi cards. The system\n\
        administrator may choose to create these files in a different location\n\
        to prevent overwriting files in a existing configuration.\n\
\n\
        The default location may be changed by either previously setting the\n\
        MPSS_VARDIR environment variable to the desired directory or using the\n\
        --vardir option.  Using the --vardir option overrides the MPSS_VARDIR\n\
        setting.\n\
\n\
        The --vardir option affects the values of the MicDir, CommonDir and\n\

        The micctrl utility by default finds the Linux kernel image and the\n\
        bulk of the root file system information for the Xeon Phi cards in the\n\
        /usr/share/mpss/boot directory. The system administrator may wish a\n\
        particular configuration to use alternate versions.\n\
\n\
        Alternate version of these files located my be specified by previously\n\
        setting the MPSS_SRCDIR environment variable or using the --srcdir\n\
        option  in the command line and instructs micctrl to look for these\n\
        files in the directory specified.\n\

	The --vardir option affects the values of the BaseDir and OSimage\n\

\n\
        The micctrl utility creates host network configuration files and\n\
        instructs the host to make active network configuration match them.\n\
        When creating alternate configurations the systems administrator will\n\
        not want to interrupt the currently running system.\n\
\n\
        Using the --netdir option to set the network configuration directory\n\
        and creates the network control files in the specified directory\n\
        instead. It also disables micctrl updating the active network\n\
        configuration of the host system.\n\

        The --distrib option will take the values 'redhat' or 'suse'. If it is\n\
        not specified the type of distribution of the host is used.  This option\n\
        would normally be used in conjunction with other options such as\n\
        --destdir for configurations to be pushed to other systems.\n\
